Title: Why Pre-Processing in CSV Files While Storing in DB is Necessary
Date: 20.11.2024
Status: Accepted
Context:
In this chat application, we work with large volumes of data in CSV files that are ingested into the database for processing and analysis. However, raw CSV data often contains inconsistencies, errors, and redundant information that can impact the reliability and performance of the database. To ensure data integrity, consistency, and efficient storage, it is essential to preprocess the CSV files before storing them in the database.
Decision:
We decided to preprocess CSV files before inserting them into the database to enhance data quality, ensure consistency with the database schema, and optimize performance.
Consequences:
Pros:
Ensures data accuracy by validating and cleaning fields.
Handles missing or incomplete data, maintaining data integrity.
Prevents duplication, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.
Reduces database load by pre-optimizing data for storage and queries.
Cons:
Increases processing time before data insertion.
May require additional computational resources for large datasets.
