Title: Considering Users and Personalized Recommendations
Date: 18.11.2024
Status: Proposed
Context:
In our GenAI chat application, user personalization has become a critical feature to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Personalized recommendations consider individual user preferences, interaction history, and contextual data to deliver tailored experiences. This approach aligns with our goal of creating a more user-centric application.
Decision:
We decided to incorporate personalized recommendations to better meet the unique needs of users. This will involve building mechanisms to capture user preferences, segmenting users based on their behavior, and dynamically adjusting recommendations based on this data.
Consequences:
Pros:
Enhanced User Engagement: Personalized interactions make users feel valued, increasing satisfaction and retention.
Improved Relevance: Recommendations align closely with user interests, boosting the effectiveness of the application.
Competitive Advantage: Personalization distinguishes the application in a crowded market, offering a unique value proposition.
Cons:
Data Privacy Concerns: Collecting and using personal data necessitates strict compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA.
Implementation Complexity: Designing and maintaining a recommendation engine requires significant effort, including model fine-tuning and data processing.
Potential Bias Risks: Algorithms might inadvertently reinforce biases in user preferences, limiting diversity in recommendations.
