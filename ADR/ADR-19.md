Title: Implementing a Feedback Loop to Promote Continuous Improvement
Date: 21.11.2024
Status: Proposed
Context:
We will ask users to give each response a thumbs up or down on this chat application. The feedback answer, question, and session ID will be noted. If the response is not sufficient, we will try to obtain thorough free text comments.  It is stored in a database. To make improvements in that area, we must keep an eye on whether the rejection rate for particular scenarios is high. Training the model for queries that have been identified and areas that require improvement.
Decision:
We are proposing this solution for the future enhancement for the response accuracy.
Consequences:
Pros:
Maintaining continuous improvement will improve response accuracy and user experience.
Improves the system's capacity to manage complex queries and edge cases.
Reduces recurrent mistakes by taking feedback into account.
Cons:
To guarantee data security and scalability, dependable approaches are required for the collection and storage of feedback data.
Recommends regular observation and evaluation of feedback.
It can be technically challenging to integrate feedback into the application logic or training loop.
