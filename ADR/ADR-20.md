Title:It is suggested that voice-to-text be implemented for database system chat.
Date: 21.11.2024
Status: Proposed
Context:
Text input is the primary means of user engagement in the current chatting system. We suggest adding a voice-to-text function to improve accessibility and user experience, particularly for those who desire hands-free engagement. This function would allow for smooth system interaction by translating voiced questions into text. 
Decision:
We suggested that, voice-to text functionality should be incorporated as a user-optional way.
Consequences:
Pros:
Offers people with disabilities or others who find typing difficult get an inclusive experience.
By simulating natural human speech, voice input improves the system's usability and intuitiveness.
Cons:
Inaccurate questions may result from speech-to-text systems misinterpreting accents, dialects, or loud surroundings.
