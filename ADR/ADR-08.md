Title: Leveraging Llama.cpp for Efficient Model Execution
Date: 18.11.2024
Status: Accepted
Context:
In this chat application, we use Llama.cpp as the backend framework for running the language model. Llama.cpp is designed for efficient inference on commodity hardware, making it an ideal choice for running large-scale models in resource-constrained environments. This approach ensures the model operates effectively without requiring high-end GPUs, enabling a broader range of deployment scenarios.
Decision:
We decided to utilize Llama.cpp to execute the model due to its lightweight design and optimized support for various hardware configurations, ensuring both cost-efficiency and performance.
Consequences:
Pros:
Efficient Resource Usage: Llama.cpp enables running large language models on consumer-grade hardware, reducing operational costs.
Flexibility: Supports a range of devices, from desktops to mobile environments, allowing for diverse deployment scenarios.
Open Source: Freely available and community-supported, promoting customization and rapid iteration.
Cons:
Complexity in Setup: May require fine-tuning and parameter adjustments to achieve optimal performance.
Potential Performance Trade-offs: Though efficient, it may not match the speed and throughput of GPU-based solutions for extremely large workloads.
Dependency on External Libraries: Compatibility issues may arise with updates or across different environments.
