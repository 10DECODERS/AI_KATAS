Title: Transitioning Away from GGUF: The Reasons Behind Our Shift
Date: 18.11.2024
Status: Accepted
Context:
In this chat application, GGUF (General Gradient Universal Format) was initially used for model format and deployment. However, as our requirements evolved, we found limitations with GGUF in terms of performance, flexibility, and compatibility with newer tools and frameworks.
Decision:
We decided to move away from GGUF in favor of more modern and optimized formats/frameworks that align better with our operational goals, including efficiency, scalability, and compatibility with state-of-the-art tools.
Consequences:
Pros:
Improved Compatibility: The new approach integrates seamlessly with modern frameworks like Llama.cpp, offering better support for diverse hardware configurations.
Enhanced Performance: Provides faster inference times and better resource utilization compared to GGUF.
Broader Community Support: The adopted solutions are widely used, ensuring active development and support.
Cons:
Migration Overhead: Moving from GGUF required reformatting, testing, and validating model integrity, leading to short-term operational overhead.
Learning Curve: Team members needed to familiarize themselves with the new format and tools.
Legacy Support Issues: Applications or pipelines dependent on GGUF had to be updated or deprecated, which added complexity.
