Title: Why We Are Not Using LangChain
Date: 18.11.2024
Status: Accepted
Context:
In this chat application, we evaluated the use of LangChain for managing complex workflows, chaining calls between models, and handling interactions with external systems like databases or APIs. While LangChain is a powerful tool for such purposes, we found it unsuitable for our specific requirements due to its overhead and the need for tighter control over our application's logic and execution.
Decision:
We decided not to use LangChain and instead opted for custom-built workflows tailored to our applicationâ€™s needs. This approach provides greater flexibility and performance optimization, aligning better with our goals.
Consequences:
Pros:
Tailored Solution: A custom-built workflow ensures greater alignment with our specific use cases and avoids unnecessary abstraction layers.
Reduced Overhead: Avoids the additional complexity and resource usage introduced by LangChain, leading to faster performance.
Flexibility: Provides direct control over model interactions, database queries, and API calls, enabling more precise optimizations.
Cons:
Development Time: Building and maintaining custom workflows requires more initial effort and ongoing support.
Less Out-of-the-Box Functionality: LangChain provides ready-made tools for tasks like document retrieval or memory management, which must now be implemented independently.
Steeper Learning Curve for Custom Approaches: Developers may need to spend extra time creating and documenting workflows for maintainability.
