Date: 15.11.2024
Status:Rejected

Context: 
In this chat application, when we tried with the proprietary model such as openAI. For sql generation it hallucinates some texts with the sql query. However, there are some limitations when it comes to cost and security for our on-premise data. There may be a chance of a data breach happening, but we cannot confirm it. 

Decision:
We chose to not using proprietary model for Gen AI applications.

Consequences:

Pros:

Encourages thoughtful financial planning by avoiding subscription and usage charges.
Enhance the privacy and security of the data by avoid using third party apis.

Cons:

Understanding the context of open  source model is lesser when compared to proprietary models
We must establish a system to operate the open-source models in order to accelerate the outcomes.
